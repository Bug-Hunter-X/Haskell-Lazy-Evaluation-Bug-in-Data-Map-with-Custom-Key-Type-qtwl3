This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and the interaction of `Data.Map` with custom data types. The issue arises when comparing keys within a `Data.Map` that involve functions or values with non-standard equality implementations.  The function `calculate` uses a `Data.Map` to store intermediate results. If the `Key` type uses a function that does not have its equality defined properly using `DeriveGeneric` and `Generic` or custom `Eq` instance, it can lead to unexpected behavior where the map does not correctly identify existing keys, leading to repeated computations instead of reusing cached results.

```haskell
import qualified Data.Map as Map

data Key = Key { getKey :: Int -> Int }

instance Eq Key where
  (Key k1) == (Key k2) = k1 1 == k2 1 --Only compares at input 1

instance Ord Key where
  compare (Key k1) (Key k2) = compare (k1 1) (k2 1)

calculate :: Key -> Integer
calculate key =
  let
    cachedResult = Map.lookup key cache
  in
  case cachedResult of
    Just result -> result
    Nothing -> let
               result = expensiveCalculation key
               in
               Map.insert key result cache >>= \newCache -> return result
               
  where
    expensiveCalculation :: Key -> Integer
    expensiveCalculation key = sum [1..1000000]

    cache :: Map.Map Key Integer
    cache = Map.empty
```
